<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Consent Manager is a 
service that securely stores participant consent records apart from the data payload.</p>

<p>In addition to personal health information (PHI) data, the <a href="https://watsonpow01.rch.stglabs.ibm.com/services/cognitive_catalog/catalog/asset.html?id=AWIHrHzHwiyMWyltT-Eh" rel="external" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">FHIR service</a> captures participants' consent for their data to
be used in a clinical study. The Consent Manager service stores the patient consent record.</p>

<p>Before participants can submit their PHI data, they must "opt-in" to share their data for a
specific <dfn class="term">purpose</dfn>. For example, if patients opt in to an Asthma study, they agree to
share their PHI data for studying asthma.</p>

<p> authorizes users (study
researchers) to access only the data that participants consent to share for a specified purpose,
such as studying asthma.</p>

<p>The Consent Manager service supports the following capabilities:</p>

<div class="p">
<ul>
<li>Consent management and consent enforcement to support purpose-based consent to protected health
information (PHI) and to comply with regulatory requirements.</li>

<li>Consent management and consent enforcement to support role-based consent, relationship-based
consent, and named-based consent to patient data and to comply with regulatory requirements.</li>

<li>Guardian consent to support minor age or incapacitated patients.</li>

<li>Consent versioning support.</li>

<li>Indicate the age until which a person is considered a minor by law in a specific geographical
area.</li>

<li>Attach <dfn class="term">terms and conditions</dfn> to a consent purpose.</li>

</ul>

<div class="p">The Consent Manager service interacts with various  services and functions, as shown in Figure
1; the following list provides examples of these interactions.<ul>
<li>The FHIR data ingestion (FHIR) function uses the Consent Manager service to check whether a
patient provided consent for a specific purpose.</li>

<li>The Patient Data Export (PDE) service uses the Consent Manager service to control role-based
access to patient data by PDE administrators and investigators.</li>

<li>The LMA service collects audit log data that the Consent manager creates and stores in
Operational system (OS) level files.</li>

<li>The Audit service collects audit trail records.</li>

<li>The FHIR, PDE, and Audit services access the Consent manager through calls that are sent to REST
APIs by using a SSL/TLS connection.</li>

</ul>

<div class="p">It is useful to familiarize yourself with the different components of the Consent Manager
service. The Consent Manager service is a Node.js application. The service uses Db2 to store consent
data, audit trail records, consent history, and access logs. The Consent Manager service consists of
three different components:<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">Consent manager application</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Node.js application. The application exposes the Consent Manager API and Audit API.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Consent data store</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Db2 database. Stores consent information.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Trail Records data store</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Db2 database. Stores audit trail records, access logs, and consent history.</dd>


</dl>
</div>

<p>The Consent manager component diagram in Figure 2 illustrates the various Consent Manager service
components and their relationships with each other. </p>

</div>

<div class="p">It is important to note the following key facts about the Consent Manager service:<ul>
<li>The Consent manager server is a Node.js application.</li>

<li>The Consent manager server is deployed in multiple instances, in a scale-out configuration, and
uses DataPower® appliances to properly balance the load
of incoming requests. </li>

<li>Each Consent manager instance is stateless, and if an instance fails, its load is handled by one
of the remaining instances. </li>

<li>The Consent manager server is controlled and monitored by M/Monit. M/Monit is used to detect any
failure of service and restart the Consent manager application if necessary. </li>

<li>The solution depends on IBM® Db2 being properly deployed in
a HA/DR configuration for replicating data in a standby database.</li>

</ul>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2196e194" data-hd-audience="InternalOnly"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2196e194">Data Protection</h2><p>Both Consent and Trail records
databases protect data at rest with Db2 native encryption.</p>
<strong>Data Protection in Motion</strong><p>All
data transactions are secured with the TLS 1.2 cryptographic protocol.</p>
<strong>Key
Management</strong><p>The keys for connecting to Consent Manager are created by DataPower.</p>
<p>The keys for connecting Consent Manager to Consent and Trail
Records databases are provided by the Db2 HADR solution and stored in the Consent Manager
application.</p>
