<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e69"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e69">A note about roles and relationships</h2>

<p>Whenever FHIR resources are either ingested or retrieved, patient consent is checked. Consent
manager is not aware of roles and relationships, which are set in the Role and Relationship Access
Manager (RRAM) service. Roles and relationships must be mapped to "purposes" before an application
sends a call operation to the Consent Manager service. Purpose is scoped to either study or program
when ingesting or retrieving data. The Orchestration component of FHIR creates a
<dfn class="term">consent</dfn> for a specific consenter and a <dfn class="term">purpose</dfn> that is connected to a role
or relationship, which is stored in the RRAM service. </p>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e92"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e92">Consent management versus consent information</h2>

<p>Consent management refers to the ingestion and retrieval of consent information, where consent
information corresponds to the Contract FHIR resource type. Consent enforcement consists in applying
the consent information to the ingestion of resources subject to consent. </p>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e101"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e101">Consent enforcement</h2>

<p>Patient consent is enforced at both ingestion and retrieval events. If an active consent (FHIR
contract resource) record is not on file for the patient and purpose of the request, the data is not
ingested or returned to the caller, and the calling client receives a <samp class="ph systemoutput">403 error
(forbidden)</samp> whenever the client attempts to create (<code class="ph codeph">POST</code>), update
(<code class="ph codeph">PUT</code>) or retrieve (<code class="ph codeph">GET</code>) patient data.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e122"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e122">Consent management interceptor</h2>

<div class="p">When a Contract resource is sent to the FHIR Server by way of a <code class="ph codeph">DELETE</code> command
(<code class="ph codeph">POST</code> or <code class="ph codeph">PUT</code> of individual Contract resources is not permitted),
an interceptor captures the request and communicates the deletion of the Contract resource based on
the <span class="keyword parmname">resourceName</span> to the Consent Manager service. The Consent Manager extracts
the patient and purpose information from the Contract resource and deletes the consent
record.<div class="steps note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Terms of Use Contracts are not sent to the Consent Manager.</div>
</div>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e146"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e146">Consent enforcement interceptor</h2>

<div class="p">Prior to the Consent management interceptor running, there is an additional interceptor that
enforces consent on read and write operations.<ul>
<li>When a write operation is sent to the FHIR Server (<code class="ph codeph">CREATE</code>,
<code class="ph codeph">UPDATE</code>, <code class="ph codeph">DELETE</code>), the “before” event is used to intercept the call
(<code class="ph codeph">beforeCreate</code>, <code class="ph codeph">beforeUpdate</code>, <code class="ph codeph">beforeDelete</code>) before
the write happens.</li>

<li>When a read operation is sent to the FHIR Server (<code class="ph codeph">READ</code>, <code class="ph codeph">VREAD</code>,
<code class="ph codeph">SEARCH</code>), the “after” event is used to intercept the call
(<code class="ph codeph">afterRead</code>, <code class="ph codeph">afterVread</code>, <code class="ph codeph">afterSearch</code>) after the
resources are read.</li>

</ul>
</div>

<p><strong>Consent enforcement interceptor checks</strong></p>

<div class="p">There are 4 primary checks that are done by the Consent enforcement interceptor:<dl>

<dt class="dlterm">Check role</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Using DMO, this check communicates to RRAM to ensure the requester, which is the internal
identifier that comes from the <code class="ph codeph">IBM-App-User-IntId</code> header (if provided, otherwise a
look up is performed using the <code class="ph codeph">IBM-App-User</code> header
is
in the role, which is pulled from the <dfn class="term">X-WHC-LSF-rolename</dfn> header, that was explicitly
specified. If a role is not specified, the role of <code class="ph codeph">Patient</code> is used by default. If
the call does not pass this role check, an exception is thrown, and the call is ended with no data
being ingested or returned to the caller.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Check relationship</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Using the value within the <dfn class="term">X-WHC-LSF-rolename</dfn>, if the <dfn class="term">rolename</dfn> value
is <code class="ph codeph">Guardian</code> or <code class="ph codeph">ThirdParty</code>, then, using DMO, a call to RRAM is made
to ensure the user has the appropriate role and has a relationship to the patient. If the role is
<code class="ph codeph">Patient</code>, the internal ID is checked to match the patient ID (in the
<code class="ph codeph">patientid</code> extension element of the resource) using the
<code class="ph codeph">IBM-App-User-IntId</code> header, if provided. Otherwise a lookup is done using the
<code class="ph codeph">IBM-App-User</code> header
.
If the call does not pass this role check, an exception is thrown, and the call is ended with no
data being ingested or returned to the caller. If the value is not <code class="ph codeph">Guardian</code>,
<code class="ph codeph">Patient</code> or <code class="ph codeph">ThirdParty</code>, the platform does not check the
relationship.</dd>



<dt class="dlterm">Check consent</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Ensures consent has been established and is active for the patient. Consent is checked against
the patient and the purpose for which the request is being made. The purpose is built based on the
details of the request: if it’s a study-based request, the purpose is built as a “studyid/siteid”
combination for a clinical study, and “appName/appVersionNumber” combination for a commercial study.
If the call operation does not pass this consent check, an exception is thrown, and the call ends
with no data being ingested or returned to the operation caller.</dd>


</dl>

</div>

<div class="p">For practitioner and dashboard user roles, there is an additional check <dl>

<dt class="dlterm">Check user access</dt>

<dd class="dlentry">Ensures that the requester has the role they claim to have, with proper access types for the
current interaction, and for the purpose derived from the resources involved in the event. For
example, this check is used to ensure a dashboard user that is associated with one study can perform
a search of all of the resources within that study and cannot access or interact with resources from
a different study.</dd>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e315"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e315">Create a tenant</h2>

<p>The following sequence diagram shows the initial process of creating a new tenant, creating an
access type, purpose, location, and minor. Only administrator users with authorization can create a
tenant. Accessing the Consent Management API requires authorization before the platform can create
or update tenants. The "Orchestrator" shown in the diagram is the Data manager orchestrator (DMO).
The Data manager orchestrator is a software development kit (SDK) that is called by the FHIR
service. DMO enforces consent rules during the data ingestion and retrieval (<code class="ph codeph">GET</code>,
<code class="ph codeph">CREATE</code>, and <code class="ph codeph">UPDATE</code>). The access type in the diagram is set to
read, write, update, transfer, and so on. The purpose in the diagram describes the purposes for
which data is collected in the system and requires consent. The final step is the creation of a role
in the Role and Relationship Access Manager (RRAM) service.</p>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e341"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e341">Capture participant consent</h2>

<p>When a participant enrolls in a study, the DMO service passes participant consent to the Consent
Manager service. The Consent Manager service stores the participant's agreement to opt in and share
their data for the study. The sequence diagram in the following figure shows the interaction to
document a specific participant’s consent choices. Consent can be given by the participant (data
subject), or by a legal guardian. At this stage, Consent manager indicates the age until which a
person is considered a minor by law in your geographic location. A consenter is also created in this
flow, which is any data subject whose personal data is collected or who needs to supply consent for
data usage (either for themselves or for a minor or other person under their guardianship). </p>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e362"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e362">Consent enforcement</h2>

<p>Consent enforcement is run to enforce policies and consent by enforcement points wherever data is
accessed in the system, as shown in the following figure. Access approval can be requested at the
purpose level only, or for accessing specific data items. More context information related to
relationships is provided by the RRAM service. In the following figure, there are two requests for
consent enforcement: the first request requires role and relationship-based access control (RBAC),
the second request is at the purpose level only. In both examples the client application requests
approval for access to data subject (patient) health data.</p>

<div class="p">The following numbered steps correspond to the enforcement process shown in Figure 6. The
<dfn class="term">Client</dfn>, at the top-left, begins the interaction.<div class="steps note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The <dfn class="term">Client</dfn> can be
any client that uses the Orchestrator component (DMO).</div>
<ol>
<li>"Check access approval" is a request that is called by the client application. The request sent
to the Orchestrator includes the Requester (optional), role, patient (consenter), purpose, and
access type (export, query, erase, notype). The examples box on the bottom right lists the possible
permutations of requests. The patient, who is the consenter (data subject who must grant consent for
their PHI to be accessed by another user and for a specific purpose), is in each request example.
<p><strong>alt</strong> Requester box</p>
</li>

<li>Requester, role, and patient are checked against role and relationship-based access control
(RBAC) as set in the Role and Relationship Access Manager (RRAM) service. The system checks whether
the requestor is a member of a role, such as <dfn class="term">data analyst</dfn>, which has permission to use
data from data subjects, such as the patient (consenter).</li>

<li>The check passes. The requester has the proper role.<p><strong>alt</strong> Role box within <strong>alt</strong>
Requester box</p>
</li>

<li>Next, a request to retrieve the purpose connected to the requester's role is sent to the RRAM
service. The request is sent to RRAM. </li>

<li>The purpose which the requester's role is connected to is returned to the Orchestrator. This
means the requester's role must have sufficient privileges to access the patient's PHI. </li>

<li>Based on the role's purpose, the patient (consenter), and access type (read, read/write, and so
on), the Orchestrator requests the Consent manager grant or deny consent. The system checks if the
patient (consenter) has consented to share their PHI with the same study (purpose) that the
requestor's role (<dfn class="term">data analyst</dfn>) is a member of. Lastly, the access type being requested
(export, query, erase, notype) is checked and if the requester's role has the appropriate
permissions (export, query, erase, notype) to the consenter's data, all conditions for consent are
satisfied.</li>

<li>Consent is granted by Consent manager. This role and relationship-based access control request
is complete.<p><strong>alt</strong> Purpose box</p>
</li>

<li>This access approval request is a purpose-level only request. The orchestrator sends the purpose
(site, study, both, and so on), patient (consenter), and access type (export, query, erase, notype)
to the Consent manager to enforce consent. If the patient (consentor) has consented to share their
PHI with the study (purpose) for which data is being requested, consent is granted for the access
type (export, query, erase, notype) specified in the request.</li>

<li>Consent manager grants consent. </li>

<li>Access to patient (consenter) information is approved. </li>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e444"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e444">Withdrawing participant consent</h2>

<p>A participant can opt out by withdrawing their consent for a specific purpose at any time. If the
participant's consent status is <dfn class="term">opt-out</dfn>, DMO does not ingest new data. However, the
withdrawal of consent does not apply to data previously ingested. Any existing data that is gathered
before the participant withdraws consent is covered by the previous consent agreement. Study
researchers can continue to access the participant data that was ingested and stored before the
withdrawal of consent.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e457"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e457">Data protection</h2>

<p>RRAM stores role and relationship data in Db2 database. All the data at rest is encrypted with
DB2 native encryption. All data transactions are secured with the TLS 1.2 protocol.</p>

</section>

<section class="section" role="region" aria-labelledby="d2466e466"><h2 class="sectiontitle" id="d2466e466">Audit trail</h2>

<p>Any creation or modification to user consent creates an audit trail record in the Trail Records
database, which includes the state of user consent with its updated fields. Changes to role and
relationship are part of Part 11 and are subject to audit requirements. For GDPR, Role and
relationship access manager (RRAM) audits the location of the user who accesses the data based on
the user’s address in the FHIR profile. For HIPAA requirements, GDAM is deployed to monitor access
to the FHIR database.</p>
